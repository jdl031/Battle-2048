## Project State
Going forward, I will not be working on 2048 multiplayer. Feel free to fork/clone/copy+paste the code and host it on your own. I'm happy to add links to others hosting a 2048 multiplayer as long as there are no ads.

# 2048
A small clone of [1024](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.veewo.a1024), based on [Saming's 2048](saming.fr/p/2048/) (also a clone).

Made just for fun. [Play it here!](http://gabrielecirulli.github.io/2048/)

That screenshot is fake by, the way. I never reached 2048 :smile:

## Contributing
Changes and improvements are more than welcome! Feel free to fork and open a pull request. Please make your changes in a specifically made branch and request to pull on `master`! If you can, please make sure the game fully works before sending the PR, as that will help speed up the process.
